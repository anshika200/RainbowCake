## steps involved to make Rainbow cake 

1. Preheat the oven at 350'F or 180'C for 15 minutes.
2. Line two 8-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and set aside. If you have more pans, the better.
3. In a large bowl stir together the dry ingredients and mix it well.Add the wet ingredients into it, one after the other and mix well.you can use essence (I used butterscotch a as love it the most )
4. Divide the batter into 6 equal parts. Approximately 1/2-3/4ths of a cup per bowl. Add one food color to each bowl and mix it well. Add as much as you want depending upon the color you desire. I used purple, blue, green, pink, yellow and red.
5. Since I had only 2 pans I had to bake 2 colors at a time, wait for it to cool down, remove it from the pan and repeat it for the next 2 colors. So 3 batches altogether.
6. Bake for about 10-12 minutes each time or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean.
7. Remove the pans from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. I used parchment paper and because it was a very thin cake I was able to take it out the pan pretty quickly. Let the cake cool on the wire rack and repeat the same process for the rest of the batter too.
8. Once all the cakes are baked and completely cooled start frosting the cake.
9. to make frosting whip the cream add desired essence.
10. when whipped cream ready divide it into 7 parts i.e. keep 1 white and then all others with the rainbow colours 
11. fill your piping and use you desired nossel to design the cake ..... you can keep the bases according to colors in rainbow and then fill white frosting in it 
12. then decorate your cake by making beautiful rainbow on the top .
